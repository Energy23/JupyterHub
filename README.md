# JupyterHub
There a severel setups, depending on what is your use-case
## Classroom Setup
This seup is a good setup for restricted courses with the possibility to use nbgrader.  
I have good experience with this setup for semester-long exercises.  
This is a good option, when you want to run several courses on one server.   
## Server Setup
This setup is good for a long-time approach. For example for your working group.  
The main advantage is that every user can modify his own docker container.  
It's also possible to run different container with different environments.   
## Temporary Spawner
If you just want to present your notebooks or you're on a conference and want to do a workshop, this is the right setup for you.  
Advantages are, that there is no need for user accounts.  

**This repo is still under contruction, the config files and how-tos will be added successively.**  
Feel free to open issues, so that the wiki can be improved.
